ITK Plugins for Osirix to perform image guided surgery

This project contains ITK filters intended to perform image guidance for
endovascular intervention, combining a preoperative CT with a series of
intraoperative 2D Fluoroscopic image.

The resulting pipeline is intended to be used as a plugin in Osirix.
